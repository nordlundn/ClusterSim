# ClusterSim

Install dependencies from EALA.yaml

Download Google Cluster trace and run traceParser.py to get arrival time in seconds since start, resource requirements, and duration in seconds of every task

Run ./setup.sh to create environment library. The same code in Python is 10x slower.

And you're ready to run traceRunner.py!
